8326	@handle Schei uit.. Drama.
8326	@handle En, wat vind je er van?
8326	Tsaaren eerste helft!! Koning!
8326	Er komt nu keihard een Duits woord door. Aufsalzen.
8326	@handle Diego, wat een voetballer.
8326	#Nalden belt me net. Volgens hem is Bayern de boel grotetijd aan het finetunen , met uitzicht op een heldenflowtje.
8326	Ik zeg het nu al, zonder dat ik ze heb: Eyewish brillen, als je van master kijken houdt!!!
8326	Ik ga nu even ontzettend Oblomov op de bank die masterwedstrijd kijken. Zie jullie in de rust, hardkomers.
8326	@handle Klaas, die kwam op je af en dan zei hij: 'hallo. ' Moet je nu mee aankomen. Dat kon allemaal, toen.
8326	@handle was vanavond zo ontzettend keizer.
8326	@handle Godskolere!! Wat een masterbril. Mooi ls ik ga lassen tijdens het schrijven.
8326	@handle Hoera. Master. Die bril gaat hard komen. Is een leeschbril. Veraf kijk ik een arend uit een boom.
8326	Klaas die kwam 30 jaar geleden al hard. Die plengde hele abtracte schilderijen bij vrouwen op hun buik. Master!!
8326	@handle Ja, kudt, zat je op de verkeerde dag!
8326	@handle Ik gok 2. Zou master zijn.
8326	Denk dat Been de overwinning van Bayern gaat opdragen aan Het Mens Makaay.
8326	Van Gaal gaat hard komen vanavond, net als de Japanners.
8326	@handle Master gejureerd!
8326	@handle Besteld bij VPRO service, heel lang geleden. Maar volgens mij nog te koop. Alleen nu zijn het er 11 geloof ik.
8326	@handle En al zie ik er geen reedt door, ik vind het nu al de mooiste brillen ooit, met schitterend zicht.
8326	@handle 1,5 en 2 doen het goed. Ik wil ze zo Herman Kuiphof mogelijk als dat kan. Zwaar montuur.
8326	@handle Klopt. Ik kwam net hard.
8326	@handle Mario Been naast Guus, het blijft een beetje de melkboer met een iets te groot jasje aan naast een industrieel.
8326	@handle Master acteur vind ik jou! Kingfish ook, zonder meer.
8326	@handle Master Deal!! Ik zeg nu al: je brillen komen hard!
8326	@handle Serieus. Vandaag in paniek bij de Hema hier. Ze hebben mijn model niet meer. Ik heb er nog 2. Ik zweer het je.
8326	@handle Keiharde weerloze blueslicks mevrouw.

8326	@handle Dan vond ik jou beter, als Bold McJohnson Jefferson McWillie laatst, tijdens die schnabbel.
8326	Ik ga morgen ook gitaar spelen tijdens dichten. Als Sacksioni mag, dan ik ook.
8326	Sakcksioni zag ik gisteren nog naast een beker met losgeld staan naast Leger Des Heils boom #dwdd
8326	Kansloos, tijdens spelen je gitaar laten vallen. Akkerman met 1 vinger in neus winnaar
8326	Sacksioni speelt een herkennigstune van een Amerikaanse negerserie. Akkerman reageert onmiddelijk
8326	Akkerman speelt gitaar zoals een ander een uitje snijdt. Om gek van te worden zo makkelijk. #dwdd
8326	@handle Reedt ja. Nieuwe spelling. Het is ook kudt.
8326	@handle Nou daar gaan we. Akkerman gaat met 1 hand spelen. Let op.
8326	@handle Klaas, die lachte om Japan. Klaas kwam als hij daar zin in had. Vaak zacht ook.
8326	@handle Spannend. Als er iemand in het publiek de verkeerde schoenen aanheeft stap hij op.
8326	@handle Akkerman gaat die Herman Van Veen Knecht helemaal naar de tiefus spelen.
